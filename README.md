# Churn_Dashboard

The Churned Customers Dashboard provides valuable insights into customer churn for a mobile company. The dashboard begins with a thorough data cleaning and transformation process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information. This involves removing any duplicate or irrelevant data, handling missing values, and standardizing the data format.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of customer churn, the dashboard incorporates various measures. One such measure is the total number of customers churned, which is calculated by applying appropriate filters to the dataset. This measure allows for a clear visualization of the overall churn rate and helps identify trends and patterns.

The visualization on the dashboard analyzes the impact of different factors on customer churn. It highlights the significance of variables such as contract type, payment method, senior citizen status, and tenure in influencing customer churn. By examining these factors, the dashboard provides actionable insights for the mobile company to devise effective strategies to reduce churn.

For instance, the visualization may reveal that customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with long-term contracts. It may also indicate that customers who pay through electronic checks have a higher churn rate. Additionally, the dashboard may show that senior citizens are more likely to churn compared to younger customers. Furthermore, the impact of tenure on churn can be analyzed, indicating whether customers who have been with the company for a shorter or longer duration are more prone to churn.

By presenting these findings in an intuitive and visually appealing manner, the Churned Customers Dashboard enables the mobile company to make data-driven decisions. The insights gained from the dashboard can be used to develop targeted retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce churn.
